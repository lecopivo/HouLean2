* VEX
  - [ ] rewrite VEX parser, prompt Claude to do almost 1-to-1 copy of lean4-alloy parser but
    - support @
    - use ; to separate argument
    - support foreach
    
  - [ ] support comments in VEX code
  - [ ] write a function that takes a snippet syntax and replaces @ with new identifies and records their type and if they are written into
  - [ ] run VCC on VEX snippet

* APEX
  - [ ] Define AttribType - which is a interface for types that can be stored on geometry
    - make sure that the interface uses `Array _` instead of built-in arrays
  - [ ] make Std.Range for Int and make for loop instance and make APEX compiler support it
  - [ ] support `for x in xs do` where `xs` is an array!
  - [ ] new elab `point/prim/vertex_wrangle% over geo { ... }` that drops down geoutils::Wrangle
        and makes sure that all the variables from local context are correctly accessed
    - all non geometry variables should recorded to a tmp geometry as detail attributes
      and accessed as such
  - [ ] new elab for `vex% { .. }` that drops RunVex node

** Missing APEX alternatives to VEX functions
  - rand, nearpoint, addprim, addpoint, addvertex, neighbours, @vtxnum, setpointgroup

  - geo::SetPointAttribValue<Vector_Array>, geo::SetPointAttribValue<Matrix_Array>


* Deriving handles for
  - [ ] ArrayType
  - [ ] TwoWaySwitch
  - [ ] Arithmetic operations
