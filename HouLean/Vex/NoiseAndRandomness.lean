Generates Worley (cellular) noise using a Chebyshev distance metric.

flownoise

Generates 1D and 3D Perlin Flow Noise from 3D and 4D data.

Evaluates a simplex noise field.

gxnoised

Evaluates a simplex noise field and its derivatives.

hscript_rand

Produces the exact same results as the Houdini expression function of the same name.

hscript_snoise

hscript_sturb

hscript_turb

Generates turbulence matching the output of the HScript turb() expression function.

mwnoise

Generates Worley (cellular) noise using a Manhattan distance metric.

mx_cellnoise

MaterialX compatible cellnoise

mx_perlin

mx_voronoi

MaterialX compatible Voronoi noise

mx_worley

MaterialX compatible Worley noise

noise

There are two forms of Perlin-style noise: a non-periodic noise which changes randomly throughout N-dimensional space, and a periodic form which repeats over a given range of space.

noised

Derivatives of Perlin Noise.

nrandom

Non-deterministic random number generation function.

onoise

These functions are similar to wnoise and vnoise.

pnoise

There are two forms of Perlin-style noise: a non-periodic noise which changes randomly throughout N-dimensional space, and a periodic form which repeats over a given range of space.

pxnoised

Periodic derivatives of Simplex Noise.

rand

Creates a random number between 0 and 1 from a seed.

random

Generate a random number based on the integer position in 1-4D space.

random_brj

Generate a uniformly distributed random number.

random_fhash

Hashes floating point numbers to integers.

random_ihash

Hashes integer numbers to integers.

random_poisson

Generates a random Poisson variable given the mean to the distribution and a seed.

random_shash

Hashes a string to an integer.

Generate a uniformly distributed random number.

snoise

These functions are similar to wnoise.

vnoise

Generates Voronoi (cellular) noise.

wnoise

xnoise

Simplex noise is very close to Perlin noise, except with the samples on a simplex mesh rather than a grid. This results in less grid artifacts. It also uses a higher order bspline to provide better derivatives. This is the periodic simplex noise
